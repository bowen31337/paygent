Progress: 183/202 (90.6%) - Session: Style & Configuration Verification

=== CURRENT SESSION WORK ===

Completed:
1. pyproject.toml Standards Verification
   - Verified PEP 621 compliance with [project] section
   - All required metadata present (name, version, description, requires-python)
   - Dependencies and optional-dependencies properly structured
   - [build-system] with hatchling backend configured
   - Comprehensive tool configurations (ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage)

2. vercel.json Best Practices Verification
   - Version 2 format with proper builds configuration
   - @vercel/python runtime with appropriate settings (1024MB memory, 60s duration)
   - Routes properly configured for API, docs, and health endpoints
   - PYTHONPATH environment variable correctly set
   - api/index.py serves as proper Vercel entry point

3. .gitignore Completeness Verification
   - All standard Python generated files excluded (__pycache__, *.pyc, .venv)
   - Environment files excluded (.env, .env.local)
   - Build artifacts excluded (build/, dist/, *.egg-info/)
   - Test coverage and cache files excluded (.coverage, htmlcov/, .pytest_cache/)
   - Project-specific files excluded (.locks/, token-consumption-report.json)
   - Database files and logs excluded (*.db, *.sqlite, logs/)

4. Constants Module Organization
   - src/core/constants.py contains comprehensive constants
   - Organized by category (Network/HTTP, Timeout/Retry, Database, Rate Limiting)
   - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming convention followed
   - Constants properly imported throughout codebase to avoid magic numbers

5. Error Messages User-Friendliness
   - src/core/errors.py provides comprehensive safe error messages
   - User-friendly descriptions with actionable guidance
   - Specific error types mapped to helpful messages
   - No stack traces or technical details leaked in production mode

6. Feature Status Updates
   - Updated feature_list.json for 6 style/configuration tests
   - Progress improved from 177/202 to 183/202 (90.6%)

=== PROJECT STATUS ===

Total Features: 202
Tests Passing: 183 (90.6%)
Failing Tests: 19 (9.4%)

Progress Breakdown:
- Functional: 170/177 (96.0% complete)
- Style: 13/25 (52.0% complete)

Significant progress on style and configuration standards! Project is now at 90% completion.

=== REMAINING WORK ===

The 19 pending features fall into categories:
1. Functional (7 items): Test coverage, async ops, concurrent requests, multi-sig
2. Style (12 items): README, docstrings, Git commit format, naming conventions

Recommendations for next session:
1. Complete remaining style verification (README, module docstrings, Git commits)
2. Address async operations tests (SQLAlchemy, Redis)
3. Test coverage improvement to reach 80% threshold
4. Focus on production readiness and code quality

Priority features to tackle next:
- Test coverage above 80% (functional)
- SQLAlchemy async operations (functional)
- Redis async operations (functional)
- README.md complete setup instructions (style)
- Module docstrings describe purpose (style)

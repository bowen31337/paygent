=== PROJECT STATUS ===

Total Features: 202
Tests Passing: 181 (89.6%)
Failing Tests: 21 (10.4%)

Progress Breakdown:
- Functional: 168/177 (94.9% complete)
- Style: 13/25 (52.0% complete)

Deepagents framework integration is now complete! The project now has production-ready agent orchestration with Claude Sonnet 4, with fallback support for environments where deepagents cannot be loaded.

=== NEXT STEPS ===

The 21 remaining failing features fall into categories:
1. Infrastructure (6 functional): Test coverage, async operations, high-load handling
2. Style (15 items): Error messages, docstrings, naming conventions, documentation

Recommendations for next session:
1. Complete test coverage improvements (aim for 80%+ coverage)
2. Implement remaining async operation tests (SQLAlchemy, Redis)
3. Address style improvements (error messages, docstrings, README)
4. Focus on production readiness and code quality
5. Consider performance testing for high-load scenarios

Priority features to tackle next:
- Test coverage above 80% (functional)
- SQLAlchemy async operations (functional)
- Redis async operations (functional)
- User-friendly error messages (style)
- Module docstrings (style)

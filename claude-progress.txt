=== PROJECT STATUS ===

Total Features: 202
DEV Complete: 161 (79.7%)
QA Passed: 161 (79.7%)
DEV Pending: 41
QA Pending: 0 🎉

Contract verification infrastructure is now complete! The project supports automated contract verification on Cronoscan with comprehensive documentation and retry mechanisms.

=== NEXT STEPS ===

The 41 pending features fall into categories:
1. Infrastructure (15 functional): Vercel integration, async ops, remaining infrastructure
2. Style (26 items): Docstrings, PEP 8, naming conventions, documentation

Recommendations for next session:
1. Address critical style issues (docstrings, type hints)
2. Test coverage improvements
3. Consider remaining infrastructure features (Vercel integration)
4. Focus on production-ready documentation and code quality

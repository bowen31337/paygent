Completed this session:
1. Fixed audit_service.py func import bug:
   - Added `func` to SQLAlchemy imports at module level
   - Fixed duplicate count query in get_session_execution_logs()

2. Verified Agent Transaction Audit Trail (13/13 tests passing ✓):
   - ExecutionLog model tracks commands, plans, tool_calls, results, costs, timing
   - ToolCall model tracks individual tool invocations with details
   - AuditService provides complete CRUD operations
   - Comprehensive test coverage including pagination, timestamps, transaction tracking
   - Feature: "Agent transaction audit trail is complete" ✓ QA VERIFIED

3. Verified Agent Fallback to OpenAI GPT-4 (5/5 tests passing ✓):
   - Fixed AsyncMock import in test_agent_fallback.py
   - Fixed mock patch paths to use correct module locations
   - Fallback logic works correctly:
     * Uses Claude when available and API key present
     * Falls back to GPT-4 when Claude unavailable
     * Falls back to GPT-4 when Claude initialization fails
     * Raises error when no LLM API keys available
     * Respects explicit model selection (openai/gpt-4)
   - Feature: "Agent fallback to OpenAI GPT-4 works when Claude unavailable" ✓ QA VERIFIED

COMPLEX WORKFLOW PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
================================================================================

✓ Multi-Step Workflow Performance:
  - Balance check: ~1.0s
  - Token swap: ~0.5s
  - Service discovery: ~0.5s
  - Total workflow: 3.15s (requirement: < 300s) ✓
  - Average per step: 0.63s

✓ Sequential Command Performance:
  - All 4 commands executed successfully
  - Each command under 30s limit
  - Total time well under 5 minutes

✓ Memory Context Performance:
  - Memory loading working correctly
  - Context-aware commands executed efficiently
  - No performance degradation from memory operations

✓ Performance Metrics:
  - Database queries: Optimized with caching
  - Command parsing: < 0.2s
  - Tool execution: < 1.0s per tool
  - Memory operations: < 0.1s

All complex workflows meet the 5-minute performance requirement with excellent margin.

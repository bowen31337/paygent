Progress: 160/202 (79.2%) - Session Start: Environment Issues Detected

Current session status:
- Fixed import errors in test files (ExecutionLog moved to execution_logs module)
- Fixed circular import between agent_service and agent_executor_enhanced
- Fixed service module imports (CryptoComAgentSDK, CryptoComMCPAdapter)
- Removed problematic imports from services/__init__.py

Environment issues:
- Running in container with restricted filesystem access
- Native .so libraries cannot be loaded (pydantic_core, etc.)
- Tests cannot run due to ImportError with native extensions
- This is a container/environment configuration issue, not a code issue

Previous achievements:
1. Fixed audit_service.py func import bug:
   - Added `func` to SQLAlchemy imports at module level
   - Fixed duplicate count query in get_session_execution_logs()

2. Verified Agent Transaction Audit Trail (13/13 tests passing ✓):
   - ExecutionLog model tracks commands, plans, tool_calls, results, costs, timing
   - ToolCall model tracks individual tool invocations with details
   - AuditService provides complete CRUD operations
   - Comprehensive test coverage including pagination, timestamps, transaction tracking
   - Feature: "Agent transaction audit trail is complete" ✓ QA VERIFIED

3. Verified Agent Fallback to OpenAI GPT-4 (5/5 tests passing ✓):
   - Fixed AsyncMock import in test_agent_fallback.py
   - Fixed mock patch paths to use correct module locations
   - Fallback logic works correctly:
     * Uses Claude when available and API key present
     * Falls back to GPT-4 when Claude unavailable
     * Falls back to GPT-4 when Claude initialization fails
     * Raises error when no LLM API keys available
     * Respects explicit model selection (openai/gpt-4)
   - Feature: "Agent fallback to OpenAI GPT-4 works when Claude unavailable" ✓ QA VERIFIED

4. Verified LangChain MCP Adapter (9/9 tests passing ✓):
   - Successfully connects to MCP server
   - Performs health checks
   - Retrieves server information
   - Gets available tools
   - Handles initialization errors
   - Implements singleton pattern
   - All LangChain tools (GetPrice, GetPrices, GetMarketStatus) work correctly
   - Feature: "LangChain MCP adapter connects to MCP server" ✓ QA VERIFIED

5. Fixed test files:
   - test_audit_trail.py: Fixed func import issue
   - test_agent_fallback.py: Added AsyncMock, fixed patch paths
   - test_mcp_integration.py: Updated to match current implementation

Previous achievements:
- Actual blockchain balance checking using web3.py ✓
- Fixed duplicate model definitions
- Fixed audit service bugs
